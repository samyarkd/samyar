When I think about boobs I might think about an attractive woman, but what about creating a circle in GLSL as a shader? huh what about it? do you think about it when you think about boobs?

Is this some kind of ability that some ppl might excel at and some might not? is it like a bandwidth or what?

The thought of writing this article came to my mind when i was writing [Brain is just a biological LLM](https://samyar.me/posts/brain-is-like-an-llm).

## Ability to change subjects

When you are focused on something, your brain can easily load and recall things that are common in the context of your focus. For example, how many hoarse powers is your car when you're talking about your car with someone.

It feels like as if our **brain prefetches the context** ahead of time. just like how a CPU does with predictable data structures (loading data from memory is slow from a CPU perspective so it tries to prefetch) you can read more about it [here](https://community.arm.com/arm-research/b/articles/posts/making-temporal-prefetchers-practical--the-misb-prefetcher).

It seems some people have more CPU cache than others and can load data faster.

## It’s tied to creativity

How much data you an load is tied to creativity because you get to connect the dots for different things easily. Like how I wrote this article [Proof that Steins Gate world is a running simulation](https://samyar.me/posts/steins-gate-and-hamming-code) I connected hamming code with steins gate, I have to say that the moment I linked the two felt so good and rewarding that I can’t explain it.

The more you load the better you can connect the dots thus the smarter you are. I believe writing is a good way to improve this ability as you can think throw your words and load different data from different things and connect them.

## Conclusion

Write long form articles. Tweeting and yapping on twitter does not count.
