I just finished another really good anime that I truly enjoyed my time with it. [**Steins Gate**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steins;Gate) was a very thought provoking anime. It’s about traveling in time. And in this article I will talk about my thoughts around Steins Gate.

The reason I liked this anime was the story and the relationship between the characters which is the emotional part of the anime I suppose but I’m not going to talk about them because it’s not that interesting to talk about a mad scientist, a couple of girls and a hacker. Though I have to say that [Okabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rintaro_Okabe) is a very relatable character (one of my most favorite) :D.

## What is it all about?

The story begins with a bizarre pace. You see a mad scientist a girl and a weird hacker that idk why he works for Okabe with skills he has. I dropped it. literally I dropped it with watching the first 2 episodes. which turned out to my biggest regret. because this anime is in my top 3 right now.

The reason it feels so bizarre is that the story is trying to provide some context to what's going on. The characters and the complex story ahead.

The kick off of the story is when his childhood friend dies and he travels back in time. to save her. but no matter what he is unable to save her. even when he can, the outcome will not be very different as the person he loves will die. and he sees their death for dozens (maybe hundreds) of times.

## Steins Gate

Steins Gate is a timeline where both of his beloved friends are alive and also WW3 did not happen.

## Is time travel possible?

The answer to these kind of questions is always “we don’t know yet” or rather “we don’t have enough data to answer”. and I rather just close this question here.

## Is universe deterministic?

universe being deterministic means we don’t have a will power and freedom of choice. everything happens because it should happen. but when time travel comes to the debate it get’s interesting because I know yesterday what I did so I can alter the past with time travel and thus get a different result. in the anime they send DMs or a message to the past to alter the past. But it seems that the world has some [auto error correction](/posts/steins-gate-and-hamming-code) because no matter how much they he tries achieving [Steins Gate]() seems is impossible.

Also universe being deterministic is a relief for me, it makes me not to worry about a lot of things. [Hakuna Matata](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakuna_Matata_(song)#Meaning>) :)

## World War 3

In this anime WW3 happens because of development of technology, whether it’s AI or Time Travel Machine. Interestingly enough to point out that we might not be very far away from it. but i'm personally an optimistic person and I believe that technology will make our lives better and we get close to peace day by day I hope.
