I have read about **Neuroplasticity** and how brain remembers things. One thing that caught my attention was that our brain although super complicated it’s just a biological LLM. _(personal thought experiment)_

> I’m sure a lot of other ppl have thought about this matter too but here is a written version (it’s 100% human :D) of what I think.

## How brain remembers things?

The brain remembers things by strengthening connections between neurons, creating a network of memory traces. This process involves encoding information, consolidating it into lasting memories, and then retrieving those memories when needed.

The more you remember the answer to [what color is the sky?](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8KBuNPyHw_/?hl=en) the easier it becomes (your brain automatically picks it up) because that connection is strong. btw the answer is: `Ay, mia amore!, Ay, mia amore!`

### Some examples

Try to sing the letters in the ABC song in reverse, or your favorite song that you know, you know it word by word from the middle. For most ppl it would be quite difficult.

Because in our brin those connections are not strong enough yet to start a chain of thoughts that leads to some actions. Or a chain of neurons firing that lead to some actions.

## How LLMs are trained?

LLMs are trained on a huge load of data, and large language models are just next token generation (perdiction based on connections). It’s amazing how far it come by such a basic foundation.

It generates the next token based on how common it’s for the token to be generated for the given context.

### The connection

When LLMs are trained on a specific topic, they consume a lot of data. So they make connections for how to generate the next token later on in a given context that is truly fascinating.

This process reminds me of [Neuroplasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity), which based on it’s definition:

> This process can occur in response to learning new skills, experiencing environmental changes, recovering from injuries, or adapting to sensory or cognitive deficits.

Is it making new connections for us to easily navigate our vessels (I guess).

## How brain makes decisions?

idk but i guess it’s related to how it remembers things.

## Free will

It seems to me that free will is nothing more than a mirage. If our brains work the way it seems it does, and LLMs are just next token prediction (sure there is more to it). We are nothing but a single domino in a cosmic domino effect.
