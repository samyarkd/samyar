They literally have auto error correction in their world. Just think about it, [Okabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rintaro_Okabe) disappears in of the episodes and everyone forgets about him, it's almost like the world auto corrects errors that should't be there. so that nothing is out of order.

## Hamming Codes

I was watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8jsijhllIA&t=897s) for the first time about error correcting algorithms, in this video, [Hamming Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_code). A short description of what is Hamming code is this in my opinion:

> Hamming Code
> is a way of automatically correcting errors in digital communications and data storage. And by errors we mean wrong bits. Everything is made of 1s and 0s. and sometimes these 1s and 0s are't always what we wanted which we call those wrong bits, errors that Hamming helps us find and fix them.

## Steins;Gate

So I'd like to point out that I have already written something about [Steins Gate here](/posts/steins-gate) if you don't know what it's, read it.

The whole series is about fighting against this auto error correction algorithm. The series starts with Okabe's friend dying and since he was messing with time-travel stuff. he actually got back in time to save her. He tried to alter the bits of his world but no matter what... the result was always the same either she or the girl he loves ends up dying and dying.

But no error correction is 100% accurate. And sometimes not even the algorithm can detect the errors. So that's when the name of the Steins Gate comes into play. Steins Gate is an outcome that both his childhood friend and his lover are alive. Basically altering the bits in a way that both of them will be alive. and also the error correction algorithm can't detect the abnormalities in the system.

## This is it

The rest depends on your imagination and curiosity to connect dots or not and disagree with me.
